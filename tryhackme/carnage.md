Task Completed
```

## First Flag

- I got the first flag from */flag.txt* 

![Image showing flag](blog/carnage/firstflag.png 'Fig.1')
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <small>Fig.1</small>
</div>

## Getting User

- In port 82 there is an upload form, we are going to intercept that with Burpsuite.

- I didn't take a screenshot so I cannot show it, but you need to use a reverse shell php script (like from pentestmonkey) and rename it to *.gif*. Then turn on intercept on Burp and upload it on the upload form on port. Then modify the *.gif* to a *.gif.php* in Burpsuite Proxy tool after it was intercepted and **forward** it. 

- Make sure you have a listener setup before you run the php script (```nc -lnvp 6969```)

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <small>Fig.2</small>
</div>

- Now click on the *.gif.php* and you have user‚ÄºÔ∏è

## Flags & Final Thoughts

- I found a flag in */home/duke*

![Image showing flag3](blog/carnage/flag3.png 'Fig.3')
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <small>Fig.3</small>
</div>

- Finding SUID Binaries was difficult as the *find* command was disabled.

- I didn't get root and Godder did manage to find a second flag on port 82 in */flag.txt*. And that was worth a lot more than the user flag. Godder ended up winning, so congrats to him! I think if I wasn't stuck on getting root I would have won, other than that thats it!
